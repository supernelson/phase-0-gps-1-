###What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
* I was struggling with the pull requests concept. I also got stuck a few times doing git init directly from command line instead of cloning a repo, which as mentioned in the videos is much easier.

###What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
* Trying to figure out the pull request and merge between two people was definitely a great real world example of how & when "code checks" would occur

###What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?####
* I asked my guide to validate if we were on the right track. Or if we were stumped to ask for general tips.*
* To my pair I asked for next steps and whether or not we were in agreement.

###What still confuses you about Git?
* I just need to go through the workflow a few more times to cement the stages in my mind. And also it would help to go through it with others to repeat the pull request to merge process with others to fully avoid any merge conflicts.

###How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
* It was very cordial. It's awesome to have a guide around, especially when we got stuck in the mud. At the same time it's understandably odd to have a silent observer onboard because in my mind I feel like it's judged.
